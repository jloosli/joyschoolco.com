Once you’ve paid for your one-time start-up fee and have paid for your lifetime lesson plan access, you’ll owe us nothing further!

Each year that you run your Joy School, you’ll need to pay a Joy School Family Membership fee for each participating family (but, of course, you pass this cost along to the families so it shouldn’t be out-of-pocket for you).

Should you decide to purchase our [Kindergarten Readiness supplement](https://poweroffamilies.com/kindergarten-readiness-program/), that would be an additional cost. But once you purchase it, you will have it forever.
