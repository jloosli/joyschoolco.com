The best Joy School teachers are those whoâ€™ve had considerable experience teaching and caring for young children. Many in-home commercial Joy School teachers are former elementary or preschool teachers. Some have taught Joy School as a co-op with other mothers and got their teaching experience that way. Some have had experience teaching children in church or other settings.  The most important qualifications of a Joy School operator are:

* an understanding and appreciation of the Joy School curriculum
* experience working with children and a good natural rapport with children
* an ability to work well with parents
* good organizational skills and basic computer skills
* a sincere desire to provide a wonderful preschool experience to children and to involve their parents in their preschool education
