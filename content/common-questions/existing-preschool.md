The Joy School curriculum can be added into just about any preschool program very effectively. Many preschools find that theyâ€™d like to enhance their existing curriculum to make their program more attractive to parents and/or to refresh things for teachers who feel that they need something new. Joy School is an excellent way to re-invent your program and add some new and exciting components.

Through a series of fun and meaningful themes, the Joy School curriculum teaches children important social skills and reinforces basic values and positive character traits. We supply you with detailed, tried-and-true lesson plans plus fun songs to go with each theme. We also supply ideas and parent materials to encourage parent participation and understanding of the Joy School curriculum.
