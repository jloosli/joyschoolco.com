We charge you a one-time application and start-up fee of only $200 (or $100 if you are a pre-existing preschool). This provides you with the our start-up manual of instructions, registration forms for your students, a parent handbook template, advertising and marketing materials, etc. All materials are delivered electronically so that you will be able to have immediate access to them once your application has been approved and you’ve paid your fee.  Click here to see what’s included in the Start-Up Kit.

In additional to your start-up fee, you’ll need to pay a one-time fee of $150 for your lifetime online access to the Year I Joy School lesson plans, music and materials.

In addition to paying your start-up fee and paying for your lesson plan access (total cost for start-up fee and lesson plan access = $250), you’ll need to purchase some supplies to set up your home or space for your Joy School.  Most Joy School operators use what they’ve already got as far as furniture, toys and supplies and do not need to spend very much money on materials.  The lesson plans call for use of very inexpensive craft supplies including paper, crayons, glue and construction paper.  Some programs decide to convert a room or garage to create a dedicated Joy School space which could involve quite a bit of money.  Most programs start simple and then build up their supplies or further enhance their space after they’ve earned enough money from Joy School to pay for such things and/or would like to expand and upgrade their program to increase their income potential.

You’ll also need to pay for a one-time lifetime Joy School Family Membership for each family enrolled in your program. They’ll pay you $50 for this membership and you will then pay us. Their Family Membership provides them with access to the Parent Introduction to each Joy as well as all the music used in Joy School so that they can understand and reinforce what their child is learning in Joy School.

Shop around – but we think you’ll find that Joy School offers the most inexpensive high-quality complete curriculum and start-up materials anywhere.
