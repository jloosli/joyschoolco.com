No problem. Many Joy School operators need to take a break for various reasons (new babies, moving, just needing a rest, etc.). During the time that you are taking a break from Joy School, you don’t pay your franchise fees or dues. When you want to start up again, you don’t have to pay your start-up fee again. Instead, you just pay a $50 restart fee (pays for the lesson updates and new forms, newsletters, etc. that have become available in your absence) and resume paying your franchise fees and dues semester by semester and getting the support and materials you need from the Joy School Company.
