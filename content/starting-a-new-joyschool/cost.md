Lesson Plan Access Fee: You’ll need to pay a one-time fee of $150 for your lifetime online access to the 
Joy School lesson plans, music and materials.

## JOY SCHOOL FAMILY MEMBERSHIP

You’ll need to pay for a one-time lifetime Joy School Family Membership for each family enrolled in 
your program. They’ll pay you $50 for this membership and you will then pay us. Their Family Membership 
provides them with access to the Parent Introduction to each Joy as well as all the music used in Joy School 
so that they can understand and reinforce what their child is learning in Joy School.

A form for you to use to inform parents about the $50 fee that must be paid for their Joy School Family 
Membership is included  in the registration form package that comes with your start-up kit.
